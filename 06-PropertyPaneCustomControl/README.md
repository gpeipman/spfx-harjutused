# Web part property pane custom control using React

## Summary

The SharePoint Framework contains a set of standard controls for the property pane. But sometimes you need additional functionality beyond the basic controls. You might need asynchronous updates to the data on a control or a specific user interface. Build a custom control for the property pane to get the functionality you need. You'll build a custom dropdown control that loads its data asynchronously from an external service without blocking the user interface of the web part.

</div>
