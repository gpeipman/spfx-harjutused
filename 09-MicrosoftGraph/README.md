# Consuming Microsoft Graph from SharePoint Framework

## Summary

Consuming REST APIs secured with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Open Authorization (OAuth 2.0) from within a SharePoint Framework client-side web part or extension is a common enterprise-level business scenario. Introduced in v1.4.1, you can use the SharePoint Framework to consume Microsoft Graph REST APIs, or any other REST API that's registered in Azure AD.
